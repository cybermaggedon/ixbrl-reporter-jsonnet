// This is a UK HMRC corptax statement with iXBRL.  This results in a single
// document containing corporation tax 'computations' plus a DPL (detailed
// profit and loss) statement.  For a corptax filing, that report would be
// included in a CT electronic filing.  The annual company accounts filing
// doesn't have enough detail and tagging to support the profit/loss
// reporting that HMRC want, hence the DPL taxonomy allows describing a
// profit/loss with the detail needed.
//
// Because DPL with detailed tagging is needed by HMRC, if you add
// extra computations to this configuration, it is really necessary to think
// about whether they should be tagged when they appear in reports.
//
// There are two main ways of changing computations which thinking about
// tagging:
// - Breaking down a computation.  Say, you might turn a single
//   computation into multiple parts, e.g. income becomes various income
//   lines which all add up to the whole income value.  Each of those parts
//   needs to have dimensions to explain how they add up to the whole.
//   This can be done by adding DetailedItem tags.
// - Adding a new computation for which no tag exists.  This requires
//   adding a tag and making sure something is picked which fits with the
//   taxonomy.
// 
// The corptax filing is nowhere near as well defined as a CH annual filing.
// Specifications are:
// - The CT600 form plus guidance.  This form is not used if you file
//   electronically, but the guidance explains what some boxes mean.
// - The CT service specification which describes the CT filing process
//   the 'Govtalk' header and the XML structure which makes up a CT filing.
// - The CT (computations) and DPL (detailed profit/loss) taxonomies which
//   describe the iXBRL which this report produces.  'Computations' means
//   working out how much corptax to pay, which means taking profits,
//   apply adjustments and rebates and splitting across financial years.
//   DPL means describing company profits calcuations by explaining
//   income and expenses in detail.  This report products CT and DPL in the
//   same report, but it may be possible to file them separately.
//   HMRC docs says that CT/DPL filing is required, but also not mandatory
//   implying you can make a CT filing without this report.  At the end of
//   the day, a corptax filing is about by being accountable to the
//   administrators and explaining your workings, so you don't get audited.
//   Makes sense to do a good job of the filing since it can be totally
//   automated.
